                A dedicated Full-Stack developer based in Hungary üìç

                From a young age, I've been fascinated by the endless
                possibilities of the internet and its ability to connect people
                around the globe. This fascination drove me to pursue a career
                in web development, where I thrive on blending creativity with
                cutting-edge technology to bring ideas to life. As a web
                developer, I've honed my skills in both frontend and backend
                development, allowing me to create seamless, user-friendly
                interfaces while ensuring robust functionality behind the
                scenes. Whether it's bringing a client's vision to fruition or
                tackling a personal project, I approach each project with
                enthusiasm and attention to detail. In addition to my technical
                expertise, I'm deeply committed to keep up the latest industry
                trends and best practices. I thrive in dynamic environments
                where I can continually learn, grow and also where transparency
                with team members is a must in communication.
